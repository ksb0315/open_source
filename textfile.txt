Pakistan's Supreme Court had ordered parliament to reassemble on Saturday morning, and it has.

It initially appeared that Imran Khan's party would attempt to delay the vote of no confidence, with the Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, known for his lengthy speeches at the best of times, embarking on a what appeared to be a deliberately meandering monologue.

Opposition MPs reacted angrily, warning that a delay would be in breach of the Supreme Court's order. There's a suggestion the vote could happen in the evening and Imran Khan is still expected to lose it.

His allies, however, are doubling down on their allegation that the attempt to oust him is part of a US orchestrated conspiracy.

They cite a diplomatic cable from the Pakistani ambassador in Washington as proof, in which he reportedly said an American official warned there would be "consequences" if Mr Khan remained prime minister because of his recent visit to Russia.

Members of Mr Khan's party in parliament have brought posters with them, one reading, "whoever is a friend of America is a traitor".

Mr Khan's opponents and US officials have dismissed the conspiracy allegation, most analysts believe it's a deliberate exaggeration of the contents of the diplomatic cable.
